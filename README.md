## My process

### Built with
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- React-18-image-gallery
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project really taught me a lot, and i learned how to pass props from one component to another, likewise learning tenary operator just make me feel comfortable in this project, and most importantly i was able to understand how to use react-image-gallery and it lightbox.

### Continued development

I would still like to focus more on react-image-gallery, React useEffect and UseRef and some tailwindcss classes like transitions, z-index and the likes.
